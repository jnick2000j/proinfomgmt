## Purpose
Sprint Planning establishes the work to be performed during the Sprint. The entire Scrum Team collaborates to create this plan.

## Preparation (Before Sprint Planning)
1. Product Backlog is refined and prioritized
2. Team capacity is calculated
3. Previous Sprint velocity is reviewed
4. Definition of Done is confirmed

## Sprint Planning Agenda

### Part 1: What can be done this Sprint? (2 hours for 2-week sprint)
1. Product Owner presents top priority items
2. Team asks clarifying questions
3. Sprint Goal is defined
4. Team selects items they can complete

### Part 2: How will the work get done? (2 hours for 2-week sprint)
1. Break down user stories into tasks
2. Estimate tasks (hours)
3. Identify dependencies
4. Confirm Sprint Backlog

## Outputs
- Sprint Goal
- Sprint Backlog
- Plan for delivering the Increment

## Best Practices
- Keep timeboxed (max 8 hours for 1-month sprint)
- Whole team participates
- Focus on collaboration, not estimation debates
- Leave buffer for unexpected work (typically 20%)

## Capacity Calculation
Team Capacity = (Number of team members) × (Available days) × (Focus factor)

Example:
- 5 team members
- 10 working days
- 80% focus factor
- Capacity = 5 × 10 × 0.8 = 40 person-days`

    content: `# RICE Prioritization Worksheet

## RICE Scoring Formula
**RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort**

## Scoring Guide

### Reach (Number of users/customers impacted per quarter)
- Estimate the number of people this will affect in a defined time period
- Use actual data where possible

### Impact (Scale: 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3)
- 3 = Massive impact
- 2 = High impact
- 1 = Medium impact
- 0.5 = Low impact
- 0.25 = Minimal impact

### Confidence (Percentage: 100%, 80%, 50%)
- 100% = High confidence (strong data)
- 80% = Medium confidence (some data)
- 50% = Low confidence (gut feel)

### Effort (Person-months)
- Estimate the total time required from all team members

## Prioritization Matrix

| Feature | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | RICE Score | Priority |
|---------|-------|--------|------------|--------|------------|----------|
| [Feature 1] | | | | | | |
| [Feature 2] | | | | | | |
| [Feature 3] | | | | | | |
| [Feature 4] | | | | | | |
| [Feature 5] | | | | | | |

## Example Calculation
Feature: Onboarding Redesign
- Reach: 5000 new users/quarter
- Impact: 2 (High)
- Confidence: 80%
- Effort: 2 person-months

RICE Score = (5000 × 2 × 0.8) / 2 = 4000
