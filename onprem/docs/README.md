### For release engineers (not operators)

If you are **building** the install / upgrade bundles (rather than
consuming them), see [`onprem/release/RELEASING.md`](../release/RELEASING.md).
It covers signing-key setup, `bump-version.sh`, `build-bundle.sh`, the
GitHub Actions release workflow, local test builds (`SKIP_IMAGES=1`),
hotfix flow, and signing-key rotation.

End-user documentation (PRINCE2 / MSP / Agile / ITIL templates and the
"Ask the Task Master" AI assistant) ships *inside* the application — open
**Documentation** in the sidebar.

## Support

For licensed customers: contact your account team or open a ticket via the
in-app **Support** page (still works on-prem; routes to your account team's
queue when telemetry is enabled, otherwise generates a `.zip` of diagnostics
you can email).
