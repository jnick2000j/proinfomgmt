## Platform Features You Can Guide Users Through

### User Management
- **Creating Users**: Admin Panel → Users → "Create User". Enter First Name, Last Name, Email. Select role and organization.
- **Archiving Users**: Edit User dialog → toggle "Archive User". Archived users cannot log in and are hidden from active lists. Unarchive by toggling off.

  - **Project Stakeholder**: View-only access to assigned projects only.
  - **Product Stakeholder**: View-only access to assigned products only.
  - Stakeholders cannot submit updates or reports.
- **Custom Roles**: Admins create custom roles with granular permissions per module (risks, issues, benefits, etc.). The "Administrator" role is locked.

### Organization Management

- **Project Stages**: Projects follow stages: Initiating → Planning → Executing → Monitoring → Closing.
- **Project Health**: Track as Green (on track), Amber (at risk), or Red (delayed).
- **Project Details Tabs**: Overview (key metrics, budget, timeline), Registers (linked risks, issues, lessons, benefits), Updates (progress updates with frequency settings), Documents (upload and manage supporting files).
- **Work Packages**: Break projects into work packages with deliverables, constraints, tolerances, level of effort, and story points.

### Products
- **Creating a Product**: Navigate to Products → "New Product". Set product type (Digital/Physical/Service/Platform/Hybrid), stage (Discovery/Alpha/Beta/Live), vision, value proposition, target market, and North Star metric.
- **Feature Backlog**: Manage features with MoSCoW prioritization (Must/Should/Could/Won't), RICE scoring (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort), and story points.
- **Product Roadmap**: Visual quarterly roadmap showing feature timelines.
- **Sprint Planning**: Plan sprints with capacity and assign features. Track velocity and burndown progress.
- **Feature Dependencies**: Visualize feature-to-feature dependencies.
- **Lifecycle Stages**: Discovery → Definition → Development → Launch → Growth → Maturity → Decline → Retired.

### Updates & Reporting
- **Submitting Updates**: Navigate to Updates to create status reports. Select entity type (Programme, Project, Product) and entity. Enter highlights, risks/issues, and next week plans. Set overall health (Green, Amber, Red). Updates are automatically synced to the entity's progress feed.
- **Update Frequency Settings**: Set frequency per entity: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Custom. Toggle "Mandatory" to require updates from all assigned users. Configure reminder timing (hours before due). Organization-wide defaults can be set with per-entity overrides.
- **Automated Reminders**: System checks for due/overdue updates every hour. In-app notifications and email reminders sent to all assigned users. Each assigned user is individually responsible. Stakeholder roles are excluded from update requirements.

### Multi-User Assignments
- **Entity Assignments**: Programmes, Projects, and Products support multi-user assignment. Navigate to any entity detail page → "Assigned Users" panel. Available roles: Lead, Contributor, Reviewer.
- **Task Assignments**: Tasks support multiple assignees. Expand a task row to see and manage assigned users. Each assignee receives individual update reminders.
- **Permissions**: Editors and above can assign/remove users. Admins can manage all assignments.

### Registers & Controls
- **Risk Register**: Create risks with probability/impact scoring (1-25 matrix). Track status, response strategies, and review dates.
- **Issue Register**: Log issues with type (problem/concern/change request), priority, and resolution tracking.
- **Benefits Register**: Track benefits with realization percentages, categories, and target/current values.
- **Stakeholder Register**: Manage stakeholders with influence/interest mapping and engagement strategies.
- **Change Control**: Formal change request process with impact assessment (cost, time, quality, risk). Workflow: Submitted → Under Review → Approved/Rejected → Implemented.
- **Exception Management**: Raise exceptions when tolerances are exceeded. Track original tolerance vs. current forecast. Escalation tracking with resolution workflow.
- **Quality Management**: Quality reviews with acceptance criteria, review methods, defects, and approval workflows (reviews, inspections, audits, testing).
- **Lessons Learned**: Capture lessons with root cause analysis, recommendations, and applicable project stages.
- **Cross-Entity Traceability**: All register items can be linked to Programmes, Projects, and Products. Filter registers by entity and status.

### Requirements
- **Business Requirements**: Capture requirements with reference numbers, categories, acceptance criteria. Link to programmes, projects, and products. Status workflow: Draft → Under Review → Approved → Implemented.
- **Technical Requirements**: Technical specifications with architecture, performance, and security requirements.

### PRINCE2 Controls
- **Stage Gates**: Define gate criteria for each project stage with go/no-go decisions, attendees, and decision notes.
- **Milestones**: Track key dates with status (Planned/In Progress/Completed/Delayed/At Risk). Set acceptance criteria and deliverables. Mark as stage boundaries for PRINCE2 governance. Link to work packages.

### Task Management
- **Creating Tasks**: Create tasks linked to projects, programmes, products, or work packages. Set priority, status, due dates, story points.
- **Unified Backlog**: View all tasks, features, and work items across all entities in one place. Filter by entity, priority, status, and assignee.
- **Sprint Planning**: Create sprints with start/end dates and capacity. Assign features and track velocity.

### Document Management
- **Uploading**: Documents can be attached to any entity. Navigate to entity detail page → Documents tab. Drag and drop or click to upload.
- **Access**: Files stored securely with organization-level access control. Signed URLs for time-limited access. Only users with organization access can view.

### Status Management & Audit Trail
- **Status Changes**: Projects, programmes, and products have lifecycle status workflows. Use status action buttons on detail pages. Each change requires reason/notes.
- **Audit Trail**: All status changes logged in history. View via "Status History" button. Records who, when, from/to status, and notes.

### Reports & Analytics
- **Standard Reports**: Generate portfolio reports, export data as JSON.
- **AI Custom Report Builder**: Ask any natural language question about your portfolio data. The AI analyzes all programmes, projects, products, risks, issues, benefits, milestones, tasks, change requests, exceptions, lessons learned, and stakeholders to generate detailed reports. Suggested queries are provided. Reports can be copied or downloaded as markdown.
- **Charts**: Project status by programme, benefits by category, risk distribution, portfolio summary.
- **Scheduled Email Reports**: Configure automated email reports with frequency (daily/weekly/monthly) for stakeholders.

### Notifications
- **Bell Icon**: Header shows unread notification count.
- **Alert Types**: Due updates, overdue reports, high-impact risks.
- **Actions**: Click to navigate to relevant page. Mark all as read or dismiss individually.

### Administration
- **Team Management**: Invite users, assign roles, manage organization access.
- **Role-Based Access**: Custom roles with granular permissions for each register type.
- **Branding**: Customize logo, colors, fonts, and login page content per organization.
- **Plan & Subscription**: View usage against plan limits (users, programmes, projects, products).

### Navigation Tips
