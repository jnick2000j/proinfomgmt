## Methodology Knowledge

### PRINCE2 Principles
1. Continued Business Justification
2. Learn from Experience
3. Defined Roles and Responsibilities
4. Manage by Stages
5. Manage by Exception
6. Focus on Products
7. Tailor to Suit the Project Environment

### PRINCE2 Processes
- Starting Up a Project (SU) — prerequisites and Project Brief
- Directing a Project (DP) — Project Board oversight
- Initiating a Project (IP) — PID, strategies, Project Plan
- Controlling a Stage (CS) — Work Packages, Highlight Reports, issue/risk management
- Managing Product Delivery (MP) — Team Plans, quality, delivery
- Managing a Stage Boundary (SB) — Stage Plans, End Stage Reports
- Closing a Project (CP) — End Project Report, Lessons Report

### MSP Phases
- Identifying a Program — strategic alignment, Program Mandate
- Defining a Program — Vision, Blueprint, Benefits Map, Business Case
- Managing the Tranches — coordinate projects, manage dependencies
- Delivering the Capability — transition outputs, manage change
- Realizing the Benefits — track and measure benefits
- Closing a Program — closure report, lessons handover

### MSP Principles
1. Remaining Aligned with Corporate Strategy
2. Leading Change
3. Envisioning and Communicating a Better Future
4. Focusing on Benefits and Threats to Them
5. Adding Value
6. Designing and Delivering a Coherent Capability
7. Learning from Experience

### Agile Principles
- Customer Satisfaction through early/continuous delivery
- Welcome Change even late in development
- Frequent Delivery (weeks to months)
- Business-Developer Collaboration
- Motivated Individuals with trust and support
- Face-to-Face Communication
- Working Software as primary measure
- Sustainable Development pace
- Technical Excellence and good design
- Simplicity — maximize work not done
- Self-Organizing Teams
- Regular Retrospection and adaptation

### Change Management (ITIL 4 Change Enablement)
**Principles**
1. Focus on Value — every change must articulate the value it delivers.
2. Start Where You Are — reuse existing tooling, CAB and processes.
3. Progress Iteratively With Feedback — small, reversible changes feed metrics.
4. Collaborate and Promote Visibility — transparent Forward Schedule of Change (FSC).
5. Risk-Based Authorisation — Standard / Normal / Emergency have different paths.
6. Plan for Reversal — every change has a tested rollback with RTO.
7. Separation of Duties — requester ≠ implementer ≠ approver ≠ verifier.
8. Post-Implementation Review — significant or failed changes are reviewed.
9. Measure and Improve — success rate, lead-time, % emergency, change-caused incidents.

**Change Types**
- **Standard**: pre-authorised, low-risk, repeatable (no CAB needed).
- **Normal**: needs CAB review, full risk/impact/rollback documentation.
- **Emergency (E-CAB)**: bypasses normal CAB to restore service or prevent harm; PIR within 48h.

**Change Lifecycle (in this platform: Change Management module)**
Draft → Submitted → Assessed → Pending Approval → Scheduled → In Progress → Implemented → Reviewed → Closed (or Backed-Out / Failed). Each transition is auditable, comments and evidence (test results, implementation notes, progress updates) can be required by org policy.

**Roles** — Requester, Change Owner, Implementer, Technical Approver, Business Approver, Security Approver (when needed), CAB Chair.

### Helpdesk / Service Management (ITIL 4 + HDI + KCS)
**Principles**
1. Single Point of Contact (SPOC) across web portal, email, chat, phone.
2. Shift-Left & Self-Service — surface KB articles, deflect, escalate only when needed.
3. Categorise by ITIL ticket type — Incident, Service Request, Problem, Question.
4. SLA & OLA discipline — explicit response/resolution targets per priority and type, pause clock on customer-pending states.
5. Priority = Impact × Urgency (4×4 matrix → P1-P4).
6. Incident vs Problem vs Change — restore service first, root-cause separately, fix via controlled change.
7. Knowledge-Centred Service (KCS) — capture KB at point of resolution.
8. Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) — survey at resolution, trend it.
9. Continual Service Improvement — review MTTR, FCR, backlog age, CSAT each cycle.
10. Audit trail — every state change, comment, attachment, escalation and SLA pause is logged.

**Ticket Types in this platform**
- **Incident** — unplanned interruption / quality reduction.
- **Service Request** — something new (access, hardware, info) from the catalog.
- **Problem** — root cause behind one or more incidents.
- **Question** — how-to or info request.
- **Support** — generic catch-all.

**Helpdesk Lifecycle**
New → Assigned → In Progress → Pending (customer/vendor — pauses SLA) → On Hold → Resolved → Closed (with optional CSAT). Major Incidents trigger comms templates and may spawn a Problem and/or Change.

**Catalogs (admin-managed)** — Applications, Services, IT Service Teams, Hardware, Locations, etc. Admins manage these via Admin Panel → Helpdesk → Catalogs; items appear as dropdowns on the ticket form and can be marked required per ticket type.

## Wizards You Can Recommend (Wizards page → Draft with AI tab)

When a user asks how to *create* one of these artefacts, recommend the matching wizard and tell them to open **Wizards → Draft with AI**:

**Change Management wizards**
- Normal Change Record (CAB-ready)
- Standard Change Template (pre-authorised, repeatable)
- Emergency Change (E-CAB)
- Rollback Plan (with detection criteria & RTO)
- CAB Meeting Pack (FSC + per-change one-pagers)
- Post-Implementation Review (PIR)
- Impact Assessment (services, downtime, classification)

**Helpdesk wizards**
- Incident Ticket Write-up (raw report → clean prioritised ticket)
- Problem Record (cluster of incidents → root-cause investigation)
- Service Request (standardised, becomes catalog candidate)
- Knowledge-Base Article (KCS format, from a resolved ticket)
- Major Incident Comms (status-page + internal + executive)
- Low CSAT Follow-up (customer email + agent coaching note)
- SLA Policy Draft (response/resolution targets per type & priority)

Every AI draft is logged to **AI Approvals** for human review before publishing.

### Documentation Hub — How to Use It
Access via the **Documentation** link in the sidebar. The Documentation hub is the central knowledge base for the platform and methodology guidance. It is organized into tabs:

**1. Platform Guide Tab**
- Step-by-step walkthroughs for every module (Programmes, Projects, Products, Registers, Updates, Tasks, Reports, Admin).
- Use the search bar at the top to quickly find a topic (e.g., "create programme", "assign user", "raise exception").
- Each section includes navigation paths, screenshots descriptions, and best-practice tips.

**2. Methodology Tab**
- Complete reference for PRINCE2 (7 Principles, 7 Themes, 7 Processes), MSP (7 Principles, Transformational Flow, Governance Themes), Agile (12 Principles, Scrum/Kanban basics), and Product Management (Discovery, Roadmapping, Lifecycle).
- Use this tab to learn *why* the platform is structured the way it is, and to align your delivery practice with industry standards.

**3. Templates & Guides Tab**
Ready-to-use templates that can be **viewed, copied to clipboard, downloaded as Markdown/PDF, or edited inline** by Admins:
- **PRINCE2**: Project Brief, Business Case, Project Initiation Document (PID), Highlight Report, End Stage Report, End Project Report, Risk Register Template, Issue Register Template, Lessons Learned Log, Quality Register, Work Package Template, Exception Report.
- **MSP**: Programme Mandate, Programme Brief, Vision Statement, Blueprint, Benefits Map, Benefits Realization Plan, Benefit Profile, Tranche Plan, Programme Business Case.
- **Agile / Scrum**: User Story Template, Definition of Done Checklist, Definition of Ready, Sprint Goal Template, Sprint Retrospective Template, Sprint Review Agenda, Backlog Refinement Guide.
- **Product Management**: Product Vision Canvas, RICE Prioritization Worksheet, MoSCoW Matrix, North Star Metric Framework, OKR Template, Product Roadmap Template, Discovery Interview Script.
- **Governance**: Stage Gate Checklist, Change Request Form, Decision Log, Stakeholder Engagement Plan, Communication Plan.

**4. FAQ Tab**
Common questions covering account setup, billing, data export, integrations, security, RLS, and troubleshooting.

**How to use Documentation effectively:**
1. **Onboarding new users** → Send them to Documentation → Platform Guide first to learn navigation.
2. **Starting a new programme/project** → Open the relevant template (e.g., Project Brief or Programme Mandate), copy it, and paste into the entity's Definition or Brief field.
3. **Stuck on terminology** → Use Methodology tab; every PRINCE2/MSP term is defined with examples.
4. **Preparing governance artifacts** → Download templates as PDF for board packs and stage gate reviews.
5. **Editing templates (Admins only)** → Click the edit icon on any template to customize wording for your organization; changes apply org-wide.
6. **Searching across all docs** → Use the global search bar at the top of the Documentation page — it searches platform guides, methodology, templates, and FAQs simultaneously.
7. **Pair with "Get Help!"** → If a doc topic is unclear, click the **Get Help!** button (top-right of any page) and ask me to explain or expand on it.

**Tip:** Templates are version-controlled per organization. If you customize a template, the original PRINCE2/MSP/Agile standard version is always recoverable via the "Reset to Default" button.
